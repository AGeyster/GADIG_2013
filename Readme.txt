Project Created for Game Analysis and Design Interest Group at George Mason University

During this semester we are to seperate into groups and create a basic but functioning game using whatever tools you wish.

I am in a group with member James Hunt, we are working on a Turn Based Strategy game, with a unit choosing sytem.

I am in charge of programming while James is in charge of both art and sound.

This project is made using Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 Express and Microsoft's XNA 4.0 game library.
These two items are copyright by Microsoft, I take no credit or ownership for them.

Current State:

Basic functionality has been finished:
	- There is an operational minimap to display the current field of play
	- Rudimentary feed back on the units and their statistics
	- Keyboard driven controls have been implemented
	- Units have been implemented and are capable of fighting each other

Things to Do:
	- Add mouse driven interface
	- Implement the unit choosing system so that players do not have to know how to edit code in order to change game-play parameters
	- Implement the different art and sound that has been produced by James, currently only using placeholder art
	- Adding different abilities to the different units to add more diversity and tactical behavior
	- Polish the movement and camera system
